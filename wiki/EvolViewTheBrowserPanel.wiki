#summary the browser panel
== the browser panel ==
<wiki:toc max_depth="4" /> 
the browser panel lists all the trees you have; the trees are organized into projects; if a tree is active, the datasets of the tree will also be shown in the browser panel. Therefore a browser panel consists mainly the following components:

  # project panel
  # tree panel
  # dataset panel

=== the project panel ===
the project panel shows related information for a project, such as the name of the project and the number of trees in this project and etc, see below:

    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-87p1nds4wdk8giu83jyhawqjcm.png

==== expand / close the member view ====
by default, the project panel is "expanded", which means all the trees in project are shown. 

a single click on the project name, all the trees will be hidden. See example bellow:

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Expanded</th><th>Closed</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>https://img.skitch.com/20111209-1iybg1bksjtj6u7ah73f84ynay.png</td>
<td>https://img.skitch.com/20111209-kcpmb9bq1977gfp58qw6xkfd2.png</td>
</tr>
</table>

==== change the color of the project ====
User can change the color of the project:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-b9x1jb6hmqke4xypj7wwp3x2rq.png
the new color will be applied to the project panel and all its trees:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-8wgxhf5dapm6ekq9d7a2mj1c1p.png

please note that the new color will be saved to server if the user has logged in; however any changes to the "DEMOS" will not be saved, regardless the login status.

==== hide the project "DEMOS" ====
by default a project "DEMOS" containing two example trees is added to the "browser panel", regardless login status.
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-b8puk61a8hpeucx8u2tyjudu12.png
For users without accounts, there is no way to hide the "DEMOS".
 
For registered users, go to "Account settings" and then click "Load sample project and tree?". The "DEMOS" project will not be loaded on  your *_next login_*.

==== add a new project ====
Users cannot add new project directly; this has to be done when a new tree is added.

==== delete a project ====
There is no direct way to delete a project either. To delete a project, you must first delete all the trees in this project; then the next time you login, the project will not be there anymore.
 
Consult here to see how to delete trees.

=== the tree panel (and its sub- panels) ===
the tree panel shows related information for a tree, it may contain sub-panels for datasets:

||a tree panel with sub panels||https://img.skitch.com/20111121-nau3nf59wjhsx7retkj9d487pq.png||
||another tree panel with sub panels||https://img.skitch.com/20111209-e1ajcu3c9ut4cypyecmkyqqus3.png||

==== expand / close the dataset panels ====
To hide /show the dataset panels, just click the tree name.

==== activate an existing tree ====
To activate a tree, simply click the tree name on the tree panel:
https://img.skitch.com/20111121-prxxyqxgutxkkprmeastnamnbf.png

Then a tree is activated:
https://img.skitch.com/20111121-r2g21881cmpnu763fnm7k9h2n2.png

==== add a new tree ====
To add a new tree, click the folder icon on the tool bar:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111209-m25dr7jy3sqj4eqcqm2w6py6nh.png

A popup dialog box will show:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111209-tq43f8g469rhftuj5xw7x343x.png

Fill in all the text boxes and then click the "Submit" button to add a new tree.

*_Please note_*:
  * both the "Name" and "Data" (tree contents) are required
  * the project name is by default "default project", if the "Project" field is left empty
  * if the project name exists, the tree will be added to the existing project; otherwise a new project will be created, and the tree will be added to it.

==== add a dataset to a tree ====
Please read here first to know more about datasets.
 
Datasets can only be added to active trees. If the active tree isn't activated yet, activate it first.
 
To add / upload a dataset, go to "Data upload" tab of the tool bar, and click the icon matching the dataset to be uploaded:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-c4kmenbie1umrqccmyhehiuhqn.png

then fill all the text fields in the popup dialog box and click "Submit":
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-pyfn9q8yhabeds2wt7an6fhqgr.png

So far there are five types of datasets, "Pies", "Branch colors", "Leaf colors", "Leaf background colors" and "Charts" (including "Color strips" and "Bars"). Multiple datasets of each of the five types can be added to a tree, for example:

||three "Pies" datasets are added to a tree||https://img.skitch.com/20111121-bqf5gdwf4s487jd9m82djp5qkq.png||
||two "Charts" are added to another tree||https://img.skitch.com/20111121-kyc9uj4j4tnq5n21wqip6f3fpe.png||

For the datasets to be displayed on the tree branches or on / under the leaf labels, only one dataset per type ("Pies", "Branch colors", "Leaf colors", "Leaf background colors" ) can be displayed; for those to be displayed next to the leaf labels ("Charts" including "Color strips" and "Bars"), multiple datasets per type can be displayed.
 
Please read here first to know more about datasets.

==== edit a tree ====
it's not possible to edit / change the contents of a tree, at least in current version. If you really need to do so, add a new tree and delete the old one instead.

==== delete a tree ====
To delete a tree, just click the "x" icon on the tree panel.
https://img.skitch.com/20111209-m69i9ysd2mjqq3rbdaky1jdea9.png

*_Please note_*:
  * only active tree can be deleted (so that users have to look at the tree first before deleting it)
  * all the datasets associated with tree will also be deleted

=== dataset related panels ===
There are two types of panels related to datasets:
  # the data type panel, and
  # the dataset panel. See below:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-dwnudajdeinq2ffy63hqg7x29e.png

The datatype panel usually consists of three parts/ widgets:
     https://img.skitch.com/20111121-n65wu29t9jj3h2wqy76hjc6yk7.png

while the dataset panel usually consists of six widgets:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-jcup9q2xyjyfhfbmx589gn8may.png

==== edit existing datasets (and resubmit) ====
To edit a dataset (of an active tree), just click the "pencil" icon:
    https://img.skitch.com/20111121-8rfh7x58ap9gbfd7dgtt23iuax.png

then a dialog box will popup; edit the contents of the existing dataset and click the "Submit" button:
  https://img.skitch.com/20111121-b5h33ckqej4w3ymkwc9fciiggg.png

*_Please note:_*
  * if the dataset isn't active, re- submitting will activated it
  * if the name is changed, the dataset will be submitted as a new one, regardless whether or the not contents are changed

==== change the order of the datasets (and the displaying order as well) ====
The orders of the datasets of the same type can be changed by simply clicking the "up" or "down" arrow icons:
||before changing the orders:||https://img.skitch.com/20111121-8n8eui5fp3e8kyr59h5wt1qwdf.png||
||after||https://img.skitch.com/20111121-nn4k9bjrb1pq8bmkji8tp39wwb.png||
Please note that the orders of the datasets will be saved to the server if the user has logged-in.
