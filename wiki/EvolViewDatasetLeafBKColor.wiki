== leaf backgroud color overview ==

leafbackground colors will change the colors of leaf background. Similar to branch colors, multiple datasets can be uploaded to a tree, but only one can be shown at a time.

Here is an example:

== supported modifiers ==

Supported Key-Value pairs for pie charts:
|| *Key* (case insensitive) || *Value* || *Description* ||
|| _*universal modifiers*_  || || ||
|| `!`Groups or `!`LegendText ||comma separated text|| Legend texts; for example 'group_a,group_b,group_c'||
|| `!`LegendStyle or `!`Style  || rect or circle or star || shapes to be plotted before the legend texts; default = rect ||
|| `!`LegendColors or `!`Colors ||comma separated color codes or names|| colors to be applied to the shapes specified by !LegendStyle; for example 'red,green,yellow' ; note the number of colors should match the number of legend fields||
|| `!`Title or `!`Legend || text || title of the legend; default = name of the dataset || 
|| `!`ShowLegends || 0 or 1 || 0 : hide legends; 1 : show legends ||
|| `!`opacity || float number between 0 to 1 || opacity of the dataset ||


== data and examples ==
Data are usually tab-delimited three-column texts, with the third column optional.

=== first column: the location ===
the first column dictates where the data to be plotted. It usually contains the name of a leaf node, or two leaf names separated by a ','.

  * one single leaf name dictates that the data will be plotted on / next to / under the leaf or the branch connecting directly to the leaf node
  * two leaf names are often used in combination with an 'ad' at the third column; see the section 'third column' for more details.

For example:
  * chicken
  * mouse,human

=== second column: color to be applied ===

=== third column: optional commands to change the default behavior of current line ===
By default, the color will only apply to the specified leaf label; for example:

the tree:
{{{
(chicken,((mouse,rat),(chimp,human)));
}}}

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Dataset</th>
<th>Plot</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
    <pre>
 ## leaf background color
mouse	red
</pre>
</td><td>

</td></tr>
</table>

By adding a third column, the default behavior can be changed. Here is a list of choices of this column:
|| *Option* (case insensitive) || *Description* ||
|| ad || apply background color to the leaf labels of all descendants ||
|| prefix || apply background color to all leaf labels that start with the string specified by the first column ||
|| suffix || apply background color to all leaf labels that end with the string specified by the first column ||
|| anywhere || apply background color to leaf labels that contain the string specified by the first column ||

For example:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Dataset</th>
<th>Plot</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>
    <pre>
 ## leaf background color
human,mouse	lightblue	ad
</pre>
</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
    <pre>
 ## leaf background color
mouse,human	grey	ad
ch	yellow	prefix
</pre>
</td><td>
