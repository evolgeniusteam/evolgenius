== branch colors overview ==

*_NOTE_*

_please send email to us (evolgenius.team@gmail.com) if you have any questions; attach your datasets and trees if necessary._

Branch colors will be applied to tree branches. Similar to pie charts, multiple datasets for branch colors can be uploaded to a tree, but only one can be shown at a time.

Here is an example:


== supported modifiers ==

Supported Key-Value pairs for pie charts:
|| *Key* (case insensitive) || *Value* || *Description* ||
|| _*universal modifiers*_  || || ||
|| `!`Groups or `!`LegendText ||comma separated text|| Legend texts; for example 'group_a,group_b,group_c'||
|| `!`LegendStyle or `!`Style  || rect or circle or star || shapes to be plotted before the legend texts; default = rect ||
|| `!`LegendColors or `!`Colors ||comma separated color codes or names|| colors to be applied to the shapes specified by !LegendStyle; for example 'red,green,yellow' ; note the number of colors should match the number of legend fields||
|| `!`Title or `!`Legend || text || title of the legend; default = name of the dataset || 
|| `!`ShowLegends || 0 or 1 || 0 : hide legends; 1 : show legends ||
|| `!`opacity || float number between 0 to 1 || opacity of the dataset ||

== data and examples ==
Data are usually tab-delimited three-column texts, with the third column optional.

=== first column: the location ===
the first column dictates where the data to be plotted. It usually contains the name of a leaf node, or two leaf names separated by a ','.

  * one single leaf name dictates that the data will be plotted on / next to / under the leaf or the branch connecting directly to the leaf node
  * two leaf names, on the hand, dictates that the data will be displayed on the branch representing the last common ancestor of the two leaf nodes

For example:
  * chicken
  * mouse,human

=== second column: color to be applied ===

=== third column: optional commands to change the default behavior of current line ===
By default, the color will only apply to the specified branch; for example:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Dataset</th>
<th>Plot</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
    <pre>
 ## branch color/ styles
human	red
</pre>
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>


By adding a third column, the default behavior can be changed. Here is a list of choices of this column:
|| *Option* (case insensitive) || *Description* ||
|| ad || apply color to all descendants ||
|| prefix || apply color to all branches connecting leaf nodes whose name starts with the string specified by the first column ||
|| suffix || apply color to all branches connecting leaf nodes whose name ends with the string specified by the first column ||
|| anywhere || apply color to all branches connecting leaf nodes whose name contains the string specified by the first column ||

See examples bellow:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Dataset</th>
<th>Plot</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
    <pre>
 ## branch color
human,mouse	red	ad
</pre>
</td>
<td>
