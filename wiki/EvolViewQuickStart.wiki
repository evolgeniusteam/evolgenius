In this "quick start", we'll show you step-by-step how to use this tool to display and customize a tree:
 
  * add a new tree (and a new project),
  * change the branch and leaf colors of the tree by uploading some datasets,
  * add two extra datasets to the tree,
  * play around with the tree and its uploaded datasets, and
  * export the customized tree as a pdf file as well as other formats
