## Tree Sharing Overview ##

Tree Sharing is a much anticipated feature that allows user to share their trees for others to view and even collaborate with.

Tree Sharing comes with three different Sharing Modes, each grants different privileges to others; see details bellow.

### The interface ###

To go to the Tree Sharing page, simply click the "Share trees" button at the header bar:

You'll be redirected to the Tree Sharing page (see bellow).

To share a tree or trees, four steps are needed:

  1. choose the tree(s) to share;
  1. choose a sharing name; it should be at least 10 characters without space;
  1. choose a Sharing Mode;
  1. click the "Share Selected Trees" button!!

If the sharing is successful, a popup panel will show:

Click the link, you'll be redirected to the Shared Trees page, which contains the following elements:

  1. a information bar shows the number of trees under the sharing ID / accession, the Sharing Mode and a link to this Wiki page
  1. a streamlined toolbar without the "Annotation upload" tab
  1. a modified Evolview logo with text "shared trees"
  1. a project panel lists the trees under the sharing ID / accession, and
  1. a canvas

See bellow:

So far three Sharing Modes are supported:
  * **Share** (default)
    * all your changes to the trees and datasets will be updated to the shared trees
    * if you delete a shared tree and dataset, they will no longer be available to others
    * others can view and interact with the tree
    * any changes made by others will NOT be saved

  * **Collaborate** (risky)
    * all your changes to the trees and datasets will be updated to the shared trees
    * if you delete a shared tree and dataset, they will no longer be available to others
    * others can view, interact with and **edit** the tree
    * any changes made by others will be saved

  * **Publish**
    * share a copy of your trees and datasets
    * you will not be able to change / delete the trees and datasets after publishing
    * the published trees and datasets are still there even when you delete the original trees and datasets
    * others can view and interact with the tree
    * any changes made by others will NOT be saved
